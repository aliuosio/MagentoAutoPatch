# Magento Auto Patch

The **Patch AutoUpdater** module for Magento 2 automates the process of checking and applying **minor patches (example: 2.4.6 - 2.4.6-p2)**. It integrates directly with Magentoâ€™s patch management system, reducing the need for manual intervention, ensuring your store remains secure and up-to-date.

## Features
- **Automated Patch Lookup**: Automatically checks for the latest patches and notifies you per E-Mail
- **Automated Patch Install**: Automatically applies the latest patches.
- **For Adobe Commerce and Magento Open Source**
- **Notifies you** before and after the update per E-Mail
- **Custom CLI Command**: Use `bin/magento patch:update` to manually check and apply patches.
- **Logging**: log errors `auto-patch.log`. This get sent on failure with the after patch notification
- **Restricted Usage** Access Control List for Backend Users depending on the User Group
