# Magento Auto Patch

## Overview

The **Patch AutoUpdater** module for Magento 2 automates the process of checking and applying **minor patches (example: 2.4.6 - 2.4.6-p2)**. It integrates directly with Magentoâ€™s patch management system, reducing the need for manual intervention, ensuring your store remains secure and up-to-date.
> PHP versions: PHP 7.4 - PHP 8.3

## Features
- **Automated Patch Lookup**: Automatically checks for the latest Magento patches.
- **Notifies you** before and after the update
- **Patch Application**: Applies patches directly via CLI or automated cron jobs.

### Disclaimer

This module, **Osio_MagentoAutoPatch**, is designed to assist with applying Magento patches automatically. **It is intended for use on test or staging servers only.** Before applying any patches or updates to a live production environment, you should thoroughly test them in a non-production environment to ensure compatibility and stability.

I, the author, **Osiozekhai Aliu**, **take no responsibility** for any issues, downtime, or broken functionality that may arise from using this module on production servers. It is strongly recommended that all patches are tested in a controlled environment before being applied to a production server.

#### Usage Instructions:
- Apply this module to a **test server** first.
- Ensure that the patch does not cause any issues in your test environment.
- Only after confirming that the test environment is stable, proceed with applying the patch manually on your production server.

By using this module, you acknowledge that you are solely responsible for any outcomes resulting from its use in production environments.
